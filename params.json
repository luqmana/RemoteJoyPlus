(TyRaNiD).\r\n\r\n It provides an easy framework which allows building\r\n client extension which can connect to the PSP receiving\r\n the output and forwarding input even simultaneously.\r\n\r\n There are currently two clients:\r\n       1) SDL Client\r\n       2) WebSockets client\r\n\r\n Both broadcast the screen and forward input to the PSP.\r\n You can even use both at the same time. Perhaps set it up\r\n such that you just launch a browsers to demo some app/game.\r\n\r\n The WebSocket client implements two sub protocols. One for\r\n the actual video frames and the other for control (input and\r\n other things like toggling the screen). Video frames are basically\r\n just sent down as is in RGBA format. An example (index.html) is\r\n provided.\r\n\r\nLicensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2006 James F. <tyranid@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Luqman A. <laden@csclub.uwaterloo.ca>\r\n \r\n","google":"","name":"RemoteJoyPlus","tagline":"Export your PSP display."}
