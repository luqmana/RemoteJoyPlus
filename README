RemoteJoy+
  
 This is based on RemoteJoy by James F. (TyRaNiD).

 It provides an easy framework which allows building
 client extension which can connect to the PSP receiving
 the output and forwarding input even simultaneously.

 There are currently two clients:
       1) SDL Client
       2) WebSockets client

 Both broadcast the screen and forward input to the PSP.
 You can even use both at the same time. Perhaps set it up
 such that you just launch a browsers to demo some app/game.

 The WebSocket client implements two sub protocols. One for
 the actual video frames and the other for control (input and
 other things like toggling the screen). Video frames are basically
 just sent down as is in RGBA format. An example (index.html) is
 provided.
