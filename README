RemoteJoy+
  
 This is based on RemoteJoy by James F. (TyRaNiD).

 It provides an easy framework which allows building
 client extension which can connect to the PSP receiving
 the output and forwarding input even simultaneously.

 Currently there exists a local SDL client which outputs to the
 screen. It doesn't accept input as of yet.
 There is also a WebSockets client which will eventually be
 able to broadcast the screen to WebSocket capable browsers
 [in due time].
